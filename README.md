### The Super Matcher ###

Impliments my Faster Fuzzy Matching script to preform faster and more effecient fuzzy matching between two data sets when compared to the Excel Fuzzy Matching add-on.

Can also enable "smart matching" on the fuzzy results, where a user can select 3 criteria groups to compare, and control a similarity value cutoff. 
"smart matching" will provide suggestions on whether or not the values are not, possibly or most likely a match between the data sets based on the groups selected to speed up manually reviewing he results.
